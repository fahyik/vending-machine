/**
 * Vending Machine Exercise
 * ========================
 *
 * Design a vending machine that would perform as follows:
 * - Once an item is selected and the appropriate amount of money is inserted, the vending machine should return the correct product.
 * - It should also return change if too much money is provided, or ask for more money if insufficient funds have been inserted.
 * - The machine should take an initial load of products and change. The change will be of denominations 1c, 2c, 5c, 10c, 20c, 50c, €1, €2.
 * - There should be a way of reloading either products or change at a later point.
 * - The machine should keep track of the products and change that it contains.
